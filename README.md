Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- A place to go for easy access to all important information throughout the course.
- Making a website study guide helps understand how to build the webpage at the same time as making a place to store all neccessary information.
- Solves the problem of being able to study with everything in the same place and organized neatly into separate sections.
